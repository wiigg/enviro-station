# :factory: Enviro Station
Enviro Station is a compact solution, designed to capture and process environmental data from edge devices, and present it in real-time on a single-page application (SPA). Its inception is a tribute to the groundbreaking work of the Central Office of Public Interest (COPI) and Imperial College London, drawing inspiration from their [recent project](https://www.addresspollution.org/).

It is currently a work in progress.
