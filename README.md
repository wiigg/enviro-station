# :factory: Azure Enviro Station
Azure Enviro Station is a relatively simple solution that ingests particulate and other environmental data from an edge device into Azure and displays it on a single-page application (SPA). It is in part inspired by a [recent project](https://www.addresspollution.org/) produced by the non-profit group the Central Office of Public Interest (Copi) and Imperial College London.

It is currently a work in progress.
